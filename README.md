# Shadow (MVP)

This is the MVP for Shadow Tours, a student project spun out of ITP 466. Shadow is a platform that aims to make the college tour experience more personalized and real. We found that the typical college tour experience is impersonal, cookie-cutter, and dry.

After talking with parents and prospective students, we found that there is a market for personalized one-on-one tour sessions with students who are willing to show their college experiences. As a result, Shadow was spun up which is why this MVP exists!
